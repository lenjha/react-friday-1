Add state
Lift state

Which components will hold static values that need to become state data?
Which closest common parent should each piece of state be lifted to?





initialize state in constructor
  call setState when you want to change it




create stateful class-based components that will record whether the app is in the state of displaying questions or state of displaying the form
  IT IS STATE BECAUSE IT MUST BE ABLE TO CHANGE

construct an event to toggle state value when completed

make new component to contain things we want to appear before the form

conditional rendering to change what's displayed depending on the current state - app can go from the state of displaying questions to the state of displaying form

unidirectional data flow - allow components to communicate and work in sync
