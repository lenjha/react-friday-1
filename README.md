#React Week 1 Friday Project#
#### Project by Lena Ha

### Description
My thoughts on the differences in development process in Angular vs. React:
The flow of data in React is much more streamlined and intuitive when compared to Angular thus far.  Of course, this could be simply be due to the progression from Angular to React and having some of the points in Angular regarding parent-child relationships hammered in with the passing of time.

This is essentially a reworking of the Angular Quest Board project, located here: https://github.com/lenjha/quest-board.

### Project Requirements
* Component tree/map is planned and drawn out
* Application uses hard-coded data (for now)
* Commit history depicts a full day's work

### Setup
Clone the project
Install the Node Package Manager
"npm run start"
Type http://localhost:8080/#/ into the URL

### Technologies
_This application uses HTML/CSS, JS, and React_

### Notes/Quessies
Were we essentially supposed to create two versions of the same application?

Figure out how to use custom/downloaded fonts instead of simply Google CSS links (so that DaFont fonts can be used!)

* Route without writing all routes in app.jsx?
* Fill in quest to add to list
