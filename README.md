#React Week 1 Friday Project#
#### Project by Lena Ha

### Description

### Project Requirements
* Component tree/map is planned and drawn out
* Application uses hard-coded data (for now)
* Commit history depicts a full day's work

### Setup

### Technologies
_This application uses HTML/CSS, JS, and React_

### Notes/Questions
Were we essentially supposed to create two versions of the same application?

Figure out how to use custom/downloaded fonts instead of simply Google CSS links (so that DaFont fonts can be used!)

* Route without writing all routes in app.jsx?
* Fill in quest to add to list
